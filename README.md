# Lab3: Classes in Java

## Objective
The goal is to explore Java classes by using existing ones and creating custom classes.

## Tasks

### Determining String Type and Actions
- **C11**: `2`: Define a class for an airplane (at least 5 fields).

### Implementation
- Create a class with an execution method.

In this method:
- Define an array of objects for the class specified in your variant (airplane for C11 = 2).
- Sort the array based on one field in ascending order and another in descending order (using standard sorting methods).

- Declare all variables in the execution method and assign their values.
### Coding Standards
The code will adhere to Java Code Conventions (or Google Java Style Guide) to ensure readability and maintainability.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
3. Run the program:
```cmd
  mvn clean install
  java -cp target/Lab3_Horai-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar org.example.Lab3Horai
```
4. Generate Javadoc:
```cmd
mvn javadoc:javadoc
```
